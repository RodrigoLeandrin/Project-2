# Project-2
<h1>My portifolio</h1>
<p> This is my first portifiolio using skills learned with Html and Css. The project started after the 27th day of studies</p>

<h2>Skills and Learning Path</h2>
My passion with technology started with games and learning English, I always saw the environment as magical, powerful and perfect. Later I noticed that visual design as a very important aspect of our lives. I always considered art with purpose, now to add to this mix, I am passionate with the idea of freedom and power of developing with code languages.
